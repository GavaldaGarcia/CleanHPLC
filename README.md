# CleanHPLC
Easy program to clean HPLC outcomes from our loved HPLC in lab N229. I know you love spending a couple of hours mining your data, but in case you have even funnier things to do just use this software to speed it up. 

To use this software just run the program from your teminal using the name of your data retrieval file as a variable argument (e.g: Python program_name.py data_retrieval_file).
